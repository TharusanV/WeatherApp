# WeatherApp
### ReactJS - Weather App

**Idea:** [App Ideas Repository](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Weather-App.md)

**Description:** Looking around it appears that whenever somebody starts getting into API's they create a Weather App and I am not different. Using axios, reading documention and watching a couple of videos made this a breeze with this project giving the starting point I needed to start using API's in other more larger scale projects.

**Preview:**
